    <h1>Congratulations!<h1>
  </head>
  <br>
    <h2> You have formally accepted Andrew onto the Crucial Skills for Web & App Developers!</h2>
    <h2> All you need to do now is put throught the paperwork and we are all good to start on 30th June 2025! </h2>
    <br>
     <h3> Look at you, making all these fantastic decisions in a single day!</h3>
     <body>On a serious note, I'm just a bedroom coder that doesn't have any formal training or coding experience. All I have is a passion to learn and enough enthusiasm to get me through any difficult sections of the course.
      <br>
        
      <br>
      I appreciate funding is probably scarce and limited, and you will have much better candidates with far greater and more impressive coding than what I just made you go through, but if you can find room for me on this course, I would absolutely love to be a part of it. 
      <br>

      <br>
      The only promises I can make are that I will work harder than anyone else, I want it more than anyone else and I will show up each time, every time, with bags of enthusiasm.
      <br>

      <br>
      I have a very long career in Operations Management (30 years now), and have "retired" from that profession and I want to be a Software Developer. Probably Full-Stack Developer, but we'll see. I'm currently unemployed and looking for work, so the prospect of an interview and maybe even a job at the end of this period would not only make my day, it would make my year.'
      <br>

      <br>
      Along with wanting to get a job in the software development field, I also have 2 video games that I would like to work on as a solo project in my spare time. I have a real love for this field and really want to get as far into it as possible.
      <br>

      <br>
      If the standard of what I've submitted is too low, I completely understand. I will be using Codecademy and Brilliant.org until the next enrollment you have in January 2026 so I will be back then...
      <br>

      <br>
      ...no doubt with a considerably better pitch!
      <br>
